Dashboard Feature
1. Introduction


1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of the Dashboard Feature. This feature will enable users to create, customize, manage, and share dashboards with multiple chart types and data sources. The system will support real-time data updates, collaboration, role-based access control, and export functionality.
1.2 Scope
The dashboard feature will allow users to:
        •        Create, edit, delete, and duplicate dashboards.
        •        Add, configure, and manage multiple charts within dashboards.
        •        Integrate with external data sources such as databases, APIs, and CSV files.
        •        Provide real-time updates and interactive elements for data visualization.
        •        Enable collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same dashboard with different permission levels.
        •        Export dashboards in various formats such as PDF, PNG, and CSV.
        •        Ensure security and scalability for handling large datasets and concurrent users.
